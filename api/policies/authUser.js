 * authUser
 * attempt to resolve which user this route is trying to work with.

 * 1) Session
 *    - User prevously authenticated with local auth, okta, or CAS
 * 2) Relay Header
 *    - A valid relay header
 * 3) Auth Token
 *    - A valud user auth token
 *
 * If a user is found it will be set in req.ab.user. This is used elsewhere
 * to ensure the user is logged in and valid.
 *    req.ab.user : {ABSiteUser}

 * This policy does not enforce log in. So the req will continue regardless
